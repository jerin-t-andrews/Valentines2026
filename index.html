<!-- 
Style:
    - Pixel art
Structure:
    - Envelope with heart stamp
        - Animated to bounce around (indicating to click on it)
    - When envelope is clicked on, switch the image to a version of the envelope that is opened
    - Then have photos of us come out of the envelope, and each image slide across the screen with a little message for each
    - Then finally a letter will slide out asking sophie to be my valentine
